# 02687-Scientific-Computing-for-Ordinary-and-Partial-Differential-Equations
This repository contains the codes for the assignments for the course 02687 Scientific Computing for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations at the Technical University of Denmark.

The codes are written in FORTRAN and MATLAB.
For compiling the the FORTRAN code I have used the gcc compiler ,more information on https://fortran-lang.org/en/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/ . 
There will be a makefiles compiling and executing the FORTRAN code(s) to make the process fast and easy for any users.
